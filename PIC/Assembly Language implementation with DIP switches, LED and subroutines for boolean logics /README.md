# Assembly Language implementation

## Notes

This project implements uses of the Assembly Language with some arithmetic, logic and branching instructions.

## Schematics

Here's the schematics of implemented codes:

## PART A)

The first part implements a basic program to input a member from the DIP switches, takes its 1's complement and display the results out to the LEDs. The 4 switches connected to PORT A are used to set a number. The content is read and masked in the lower 4-digit and stored in to the variable InB. The result is displayed on PORT C using 'COMF', 'MOVWF' and 'MOVFF' instructions. It shows the 1's complement of the number specified by the DIP switches.

## PART B)

The same operation as part a) is added but a test condition is added. The test is added after the completion of the Complement operation. The Zero (Z flag) is set through the use of the instruction BZ. If Z flag is 1, BZ will force a jump to a label where PORTE bit 1 is set to 1. If Z flag is 0, the instruction just below the BZ instruction will be executed.

## PART C)

A new operation is implemented to add two numbers. The routine developed in part b) is copied to add codes and read a second input from PORTA and stored into the variable 'In_A' and stored the result into 'Result'. The result is displayed into PORT C and shown on the 5 LEDs. The fifth LED of PORT C shows the overflow of the result of the addition of two 4-bit numbers.

## PART D)

The ADD operation on part c) is replaced by doing the 'OR' operation with the instruction 'ORWF     f, W'.

## PART E)

The ADD operation on part c) is replaced by doing the 'XOR' operation with the instruction 'XORWF     f, W'.

## PART F)

The last routine is added by taking a 4-bit input number and convert into s BCD number which is the decimal equivalent of the input number. The input number is checked against the value 0x09. If it is greater than 9, then add a constant 0x06 to it. If it is less than 9, then no addition of the constant is needed. The operationis implemented by reading the input into the varaible 'InB', loadig a constant 0x09 into W and using the instruction CPFSGT to compare the value in 'InB' against the W register.

## PART G)

The five functions implemented above are grouped into five different sets of code, SUBROUTINE_COMP, SUBROUTINE_ADD, SUBROUTINE_OR, SUBROUTINE_XOR, SUBROUTINE_BCD. The 'BTFSC' instructions are used to do the decoding of the five tasks. The BCF and BSF are used to set the three bits 6-4 of the PORTD to show what routine is being exceuted.

PORT D                  Action
Bit_2 Bit_1 Bit_0 
 0 0 0                  1â€™s complement 
 0 0 1                  ADD operation 
 0 1 0                  OR operation 
 0 1 1                  XOR operation 
 1 0 0                  BCD conversion
