# Implementation of LCD Panel in a Traffic Light Controller

## Notes

The new circuit will have a TFT LCD display to show the operation of the controller developed in the Traffic Light Controller with use of System Timer. The circuit will still have four sets of RGB LEDs, four DIP switches, a light sensor, an LED to show the mode, a 1-second pulse LED, two 7-segment LEDs, and a buzzer circuit. The modification involves using an LCD TFT Display instead of the two 7-segment displays and some of the RGB LEDs will have new connections. The TFT screen displays the mode the controller is running, the color of the traffic light in each direction, the number of seconds left for the traffic light in each direction, and the number of seconds left on the pedestrian counter in each direction. The operation of the traffic light remains the same, and both the Night and Day modes should be kept the same.
