LAB1 - 2 to 1 Mux

LAB1 description: 

2 to1 multiplexer is designed by using vivado software and test the results with FPGA. 2 input ‘a’ and ‘b’ will each be 4 bits, ‘sel’ which is select line will be just 1 bit. Output ‘f’ will be also 4 bits. If selected line ‘sel’ equals 0, output ‘f’ will be same as input ‘a’. Else, if the selected line ‘sel’ equals 0, output ‘f’ will be the same as input ‘b’.
