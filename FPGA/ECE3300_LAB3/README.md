LAB3 - 16 bit Full Adder connected with 16 bit Demultiplexer by using instantiation 

ECE3300L.02 - Summer 2022

Group A : Jihun Choi(Bronco ID#: 011841206)


LAB3 description:

16 bit Full Adder connected with 16 bit Demultiplexer is designed by using vivado software and test the results with FPGA. First, 1 bit Full Adder was designed by the results of its k-maps. And Demultiplexer was designed by using its functionality. if sel equals high, input ‘in’ equals to output ‘out1’, else input ‘in’ equals to output ‘out0.’ Using the idea of instantiation and parameter, module ‘top’ was created to design n-bit Full Adder connected with n-bit Demultiplexer. For this lab, n equals 16 which is 16 bit FA with 16 bit Demux.
